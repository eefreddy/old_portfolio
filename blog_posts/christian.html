                    <span class="subheading text-muted" align='left'>Recently, my dad asked me to outline some obstacles teens face on their path to seeking god’s kingdom. It was a for a friend of his who was helping out at a youth camp. So I quickly typed out a few points on my phone and sent it away. He loved it (he appreciates everything thing I do, even if it isn’t that great haha) and told me to expand on it and put it up somewhere, so here goes. <br><br>Before you read this, I should clarify what the term “pillars of faith” means to me. I think every religious person have their pillars of faith. To me, these are the elements that hold up your monument called faith. Like the analogy, the faith doesn’t crumble as long as the pillars are intact (I’m not a civil engineer so excuse my lack of structural knowledge). I believe that people find their pillars as they progress through their spiritual journey.</span>

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>Obstacle #1: False doctrine</h4>

<p align='justify'>Don’t we all face this in one form or another? Fake news is all the rage these days. People are quite often trying to earn money by having a saucy headline just to get viewership.</p> 

<p align='justify'>Similarly it is also quite prevalent in Christianity but not in the same way. As a young christian forming their world views, it is important to know the difference between Christian teachings and a preachers own social beliefs. Far too often we have preachers using Christianity to promote their own social agenda. It is paramount that young believers are taught to distinguish between someone’s person views and Christianity itself. They need to be able to find their pillars of faith and build their world view around it. In an ever changing world, we need to realize that Christianity is modern and forward thinking, its just the preachers who are not.</p> 

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>Obstacle #2: Ancient teachings of churches (not updated with the time)</h4>


                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/chris_3.jpg" alt="">

                    <span class='text-muted'>For Example: Belief in the creation story!</span>

<p align='justify'>Once, a curious young christian hesitantly asked the preacher at a youth camp about their thoughts on evolution. The events that followed reminded him of the movie “2012”. The preacher yelled at him, questioned his faith and every one started shouting their beliefs of how Darwin was and claimed that he said his research was false (not true). They questioned the young believer if he was even Christian and quite quickly the situation devolved into chaos. How can you be Christian if you believe in such “non-sense”? Why don’t we see monkeys turning into men now? </p>

<span class='text-muted'>Is this the right response? </span>

<p align='justify'>Probably not, right? You see, it wasn’t just me… erm I mean this curious young christian, it was also his peers that had these questions. Seeing him grilled like marinated meat quite frankly scared them too. </p>

<p align='justify'>Every Christian has their core beliefs. Pillars that hold up the great monument that is your faith. If the pillars fall, the monument falls. Ya gotta get some strong pillars! </p>

<p align='justify'>As in the situation above, is your faith shaken if modern scientific findings such as evolution and the big bang theory are proven to be true? Is your faith shaken if you find out that Jesus took a wife or had children? The answer should be no! Because none of these things form the pillars of christianity. </p>


                        <img class="img-responsive" src="/blog_posts/img/chris_2.jpg" alt="">
                    
<p align='justify'>It doesn’t really matter if all these things are true! My main pillar is that Jesus came and died for our sins and as long as that is true, who cares about anything else? </p>

<p align='justify'>Does it really matter if the world was created through the big bang or if we descended through primal ape like creatures? Not really! The point of the creation story in the book of Genesis is to tell us that God created the world! As long as we believe that, it doesn't matter how he created it. He either made Adam out of clay or set in motion the events that led to the evolution of tiny single celled creatures into humans. </p>

                    <blockquote>"The lord determines the number of stars; he gives to all of them their names. Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure" Psalm 147, verse 4-5 </blockquote>

<p align='justify'>Humans are unfortunately none of those things, try explaining the concepts of evolution or relativity to those guys trying to avoid being turned into salt.</p>

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>Quick fire round:</h4>
                    
                    <p align='justify'>I will shout out some obstacles and you can shout out your one word solutions! Just kidding, none of these have easy one word solutions or a solutions that fits everyone. Everyones got to find their own way to deal with it. I’d love to hear your thoughts so shoot me an email!</p>

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>Society!</h4> 
                    <p align='justify'>In an increasingly agnostic/atheistic society, how do you keep/express your faith? Can this affect you? How can you overcome this?</p>

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>Technology!</h4>  
                    <p align='justify'>How does the age of the internet affect your faith? Does it make it easier to follow your faith or harder? Is there any way to use technology to spread Christianity to the masses? How do we harness this power and use it on our path to God's kingdom?</p>

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>Relationships!</h4>  
<p align='justify'>Does having a girlfriend/boyfriend make you any less of a Christian? Justify! Can you have a relationship with a person from another religion? How does that impact your faith?</p>

<h4 class='subheading' align='left'>What about alcohol?</h4>
                    <p align='justify'>Does drinking a glass of wine make you any less of a Christian? Or is it just good common sense to not binge drink/get super drunk and put yourself in danger?</p>

<hr>

<p align='justify'>I recently participated in a pride parade in Edmonton, it was a lot of fun so in honour of pride week I’ll finish with this one:</p>

<p align='justify'>How do we differentiate between what is society's moral views and Christianity's moral views? Some christians do not accept homosexuality. They term it a sin. Is this the right approach? Why?</p> 


<blockquote>James 4:12 --12 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbour?</blockquote>


<p align='justify'>This is quite a controversial topic, especially in India! For me, it is quite clear. Homophobia has no place in society never mind religion. If your religion tells you to not accept homosexuality then your religion simply is not my christianity. </p>

<blockquote>Galatians 5:14 For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”</blockquote>

<h4 align='justify'>I’ll finish by reminding you that most of the things I’ve talked about are from my perspective so naturally they are peppered with my social views and based on my pillars of faith. So find your world view and belief system, question the system, fight the power… okay I'm getting carried away. Just don’t blindly accept everything, question and quantify the sources just like you would with fake news! </h4>
